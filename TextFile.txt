Write a program that reads a text file, 
counts occurrences of every word in this file, 
and outputs results: a word and its count separated by space, one line for one word. 
The program must be a Console Application. It must read target file name from command line arguments. 
Your result must be a C# project - either an archive or an online git repo.
